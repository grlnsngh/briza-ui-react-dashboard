# UI Improvements Quick Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. Dark Theme Readability ✅

**Problem:** Blue text on blue background hard to read  
**Solution:** Changed to dark surface with colored borders and white text

**Test:** Switch to dark theme (click 🌓 button) and check:

- Getting Started banner (should have white text with blue border)
- Web Vitals banners (should be readable)
- All info messages (should have high contrast)

### 2. Duplicate Status Icons ✅

**Problem:** Two green status indicators confusing users  
**Solution:** Sidebar now shows Web Vitals score or Active/Paused text

**Test:** Check sidebar:

- Before: "Status: ● Active" (duplicate)
- After: "Web Vitals: 100" or "Monitoring: Active" (unique info)

### 3. Theme Toggle Animation ✅

**Problem:** Theme button tilts/rotates on hover (annoying)  
**Solution:** Removed rotation, added subtle border glow

**Test:** Hover over 🌓 button in header:

- Should NOT rotate/tilt
- Should show blue border glow
- Should scale down smoothly when clicked

### 4. Better Contrast ✅

**Problem:** Poor visibility in dark mode  
**Solution:** Updated color palette with better contrast

**Test:** Toggle between light/dark themes:

- All text should be clearly readable
- Borders should be visible
- Cards should stand out from background
